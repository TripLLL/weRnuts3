# weRnuts3


During the Correlaid Mettup in Berlin, we played around with the data available on regionalstatistik.de via the [DatenguideR package](https://github.com/CorrelAid/datenguideR). 

Here is what we came up with (code and data in repo)


**Version 1**
![Version 1](https://github.com/TripLLL/weRnuts3/blob/master/trash_emoji.gif?raw=true)

**Version2**
![Version 2](https://github.com/TripLLL/weRnuts3/blob/master/trash_rainbow.gif?raw=true)


Let us know what you think :)
